# interworld sludge zone, abbeydale fly tower, 3/9/23

success !

- first set went well without any real hitches!
- some nice comments despite being v nervous
- amazing cavernous venue space
- ended up using the bells in the end :)

thoughts for future

- don't rush thru the set too quickly!
- try to think about space size. the sheet was dwarfed by the room and projections, people further away wouldn't have noticed sheet/sound connection
- jake suggested including underlying layer during sparser note trigger segments
- ray suggested making the sheet/sound connection more obvious, so may need to look into how best to use the Kinect or use other sensors
- 2 people mentioned that the sheet/fans could be mic'd up..!
- try out a different structure eg sparse->dense->sparse
